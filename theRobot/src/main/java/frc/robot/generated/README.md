In order to support multiple drive bases to be used with this code, 
Rename both the TunerConstants.java and tuner-swerve-project.json files
to be specific for each robot. 

For example the TuneConstants.java for Ted is renamed TedTunerConstants.java and 
tuner-swerve-project.json is renamed ted-tuner-swerve-project.json
