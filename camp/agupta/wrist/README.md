# Software Libraries

- For control, we use [motion magic](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/2024/docs/api-reference/device-specific/talonfx/motion-magic.html)
- The following parameters must be set when controlling using Motion MagicÂ®
    - Cruise Velocity - peak/cruising velocity of the motion
    - Acceleration - controls acceleration and deceleration rates during the beginning and end of motion
    - Jerk (optional) - controls jerk, which is the derivative of acceleration
